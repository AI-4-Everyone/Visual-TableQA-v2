# 🧠 Visual-TableQA: Open-Domain Benchmark for Reasoning over Table Images

Welcome to **Visual-TableQA**, a project designed to generate high-quality **synthetic question-answer datasets** associated to **images of tables**. This resource is ideal for training and evaluating models on visually-grounded table understanding tasks such as **document QA**, **table parsing**, and **multimodal reasoning**.

## 🚀 Latest Update

We have refreshed the dataset with **newly generated QA pairs** created by stronger and more reliable LLMs, including:

- **GPT-5**
- **Claude-Sonnet-4**
- **Gemini-2.5-Pro**

### ✅ Quality Assessment

To ensure higher reliability, all QA pairs were evaluated by a **jury of advanced models**:

- **Gemini-2.5-Pro**
- **GPT-4.1**
- **Mistral-Large**
- **DeepCogito-v2**
- **DeepSeek-v3.1**

This multi-model jury setup improves consistency and reduces bias compared to earlier versions.

---

🔄 **What’s new compared to the previous release:**
- More diverse and accurate QA pairs, generated by frontier-level LLMs.
- Stronger evaluation pipeline, with cross-validation from multiple independent models.
- Higher alignment between questions and table content, with reduced hallucination rate.

We recommend using this updated release for **benchmarking visual reasoning** and **fine-tuning multimodal models**, as it provides higher quality and more trustworthy supervision signals.

## 🚀🚀 Getting Started
To quickly load and explore the dataset in Python, you can use the 🤗 `datasets` library:

```python
from datasets import load_dataset

# Load the test split of the Im2TeX dataset
dataset = load_dataset('AI-4-Everyone/Visual-TableQA')

# Print dataset info
print(dataset)
```

## 🔄 Pipeline

The synthetic data generation pipeline in **Visual-TableQA** follows a multi-stage process combining vision-language models (VLMs), large language models (LLMs), and structured logic:

1. **Offline Preparation**: Using table images and textual prompts, a VLM and LLM generate LaTeX-style table templates and thematic concepts.
2. **Table Synthesis**: These instructions are passed to another LLM to generate diverse structured tables in JSON format, which are then rendered into images.
3. **QA Generation**: An additional LLM generates multiple QA pairs for each table, guided by reasoning-based prompts.
4. **Validation**: A group of LLMs acts as a jury to validate the correctness and relevance of each QA pair.
5. **Export**: Validated image–question–answer triplets are saved in a standardized format, ready for training and evaluation.

The complete pipeline is illustrated below:
